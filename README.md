# FYP - Gamification Repository

This is the repository for managing the gamification elements of my Gamified Learning Environment where I plan to Implement an array of gamified features such as achievements, progress tracking, and leaderboards to enhance a studentâ€™s motivation to learn.

### Contains: 
Logic for awarding achievements, managing points, and updating leaderboards.
### Technologies: 
Python (Flask/FastAPI), NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB) for storing user scores and achievements.
